# PROJECT

## Vision
Build a simple 3D infinite runner in the browser to learn how glTF models and Three.js can create elegant, smooth 3D web experiences.

## Success criteria
- [ ] App runs locally with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Chicken player can switch lanes and jump smoothly
- [ ] Cat obstacles recycle (pooling) and collisions trigger "death"

## Users
- Primary user: me (learning + experimenting)
- Secondary user: anyone who wants to try the demo

## Constraints
- Tech: Vite + React + TypeScript + Three.js (core); delta-time updates; SRGB + ACES; assets from `/public/models`
- Time: learn by building small milestones
- Budget: free
- Devices: Windows (dev), modern browsers

## Non-goals
- (What you explicitly won't build yet)

## Milestones
1) MVP:
2) Beta:
3) V1:
